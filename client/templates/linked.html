<div style="position:absolute;top:0px;left:50%;width:50%;z-index:1000;background-color:white;">
  <h1>Linked</h1>
<p>
Idea is to characterize the links between features and questions - this can be in the form of features?
So, for example, if you say that one pt. is "like" another, you can show it
  having the link include images of what is similar, or some other way of characterizing the similarity?
