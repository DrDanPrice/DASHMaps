<div style="position:absolute;top:0px;left:50%;width:50%;z-index:1000;background-color:white;">
<h1>Map</h1>
<p>perhaps some info on how map works, depending on which id?
this would be hidden, but filled with info about the map - maybe just from the description in the
style, or other things that you might want to show without them having all the style stuff available.

</div>
