decision - place of
Plato - doesn't matter who says the truth as long as the true thing is said
Aristotle - true thing doesn't have to be said in order for good to happen
(phronesis/praxis, etc.; not always how he's been read)
For Plato, that the place of decision is in the no-place of the ideal.
For Kant, that the place of decision is in the no-place of the mind.

For the political question - that the place about which we decide is, first,
the place about which we have some evidence concerning what is true or false.
Then, second, that we follow the right rules for generalizing concerning those
truths.
How do we know that a group of people counts as having the same evidence?
The example in terms of PCA and knowing how many dimensions are needed to come to
an agreement, instead of knowing what a particular function of judgment is
about may be the better place to start.



For forms - idea is to perhaps use "scene" logic to create an html that fills in
a ControlGroup, then a control - so that different components can use the same
html, with the list for the settings coming from the class definitions??
